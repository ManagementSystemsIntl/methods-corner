### What is Data Science? Advanced analytics?

- Data science: The extraction of learning from data

- Advanced analytics: The application of methods that learn from the data

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="20%", fig.show='hold', echo=F}

include_graphics("Data science life cycle.png") 
# need not be case sensitive locally, but is case sensitive for GH Pages

```

### DALL-E's view of the MSI data science team

"a data science team solving complex analytical problems while at the climbing gym, in the style of anime"

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="40%", fig.show='hold', echo=F}

include_graphics("dalle data science climbing.png")

```

### Robust external demand for advanced analytics

- USAID's 2011 evaluation policy remains in force, offering the opportunity for impact evaluations

- USAID references analytics in its solicitations (simulation, social network analysis, modeling)

- New data sources require deeper understanding, processing, and analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Robust internal demand for advanced analytics

- We lost our analysts!

- MSI junior / midlevel staff interested in gaining skills and experience / dedicated experience path

- MSI needs to document and build its past performance and capabilities for new business

- Need to justify / defend analytical choices

---- 

### Data science and advanced analytics

Three primary areas of action

- Best practice application of technique to extract learning
- Build capacity of interested staff
- Document past practice to help win new business

---- 

### Application of technique to extract learning

```{r echo = F}
tech <- read_excel("Analytical techniques.xlsx")

gt(tech)
```

----

### Build capacity of interested staff

- Structured trainings on-demand, hopefully at least once per year
- 4-12 brown bag sessions per year
- Weekly office hours / on-demand consultation

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="40%", fig.show='hold', echo=F}

include_graphics("Quarto website.png")

```

----

### Document past practice and identify new opportunities

- Inventory of techniques, activities, and analysts
- Review existing task pipeline for opportunities to apply technique
- Demonstrate new techniques to expand performance and capabilities

---- 

### Tasks

- Build and maintain trackers of techniques, where they were used, which staff implemented them
- Identify interested and capable staff
- Develop comms on current performance and capabilities
- Develop how-to manual / cookbook on analytical workflow
- Develop content for training and brown bag sessions

----

### Where are we headed? 


The increasing integration of human and machine intelligence to (hopefully) solve problems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Working with AI to set up your analyses
