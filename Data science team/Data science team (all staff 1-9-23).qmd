### What is Data Science? Advanced analytics?

-   Data science: The extraction of learning from data

-   Advanced analytics: The application of methods that learn from the data

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="20%", fig.show='hold', echo=F}

include_graphics("Data science life cycle.png") 
# need not be case sensitive locally, but is case sensitive for GH Pages

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Robust external demand for advanced analytics

-   USAID's 2011 evaluation policy remains in force, offering the opportunity for impact evaluations

-   USAID references analytics in its solicitations (simulation, social network analysis, modeling)

-   New data sources require deeper understanding, processing, and analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Robust internal demand for advanced analytics

-   We lost our analysts!

-   MSI junior / midlevel staff interested in gaining skills and experience / dedicated experience path

-   MSI needs to document and build its past performance and capabilities for new business

-   Need to justify / defend analytical choices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data science and advanced analytics

Three primary areas of action

-   Best practice application of technique to extract learning
-   Build capacity of interested staff
-   Document past practice to help win new business

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Application of technique to extract learning

```{r echo = F}
tech <- read_excel("Analytical techniques.xlsx")

#gt(tech)

#kable(tech)

tech_gt <- gt(tech)
tech_gt
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Build capacity of interested staff

-   Structured trainings, hopefully at least once per year
-   4-12 brown bag sessions per year
-   Weekly office hours / on-demand consultation

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="40%", fig.show='hold', echo=F}

include_graphics("Quarto website.png")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Document past practice and identify new opportunities

-   Inventory of techniques, activities, and analysts
-   Review existing task pipeline for opportunities to apply technique
-   Demonstrate new techniques to expand performance and capabilities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tasks

-   Build and maintain trackers of techniques, where they were used, which staff implemented them
-   Identify interested and capable staff
-   Develop comms on current performance and capabilities
-   Develop how-to manual / cookbook on analytical workflow
-   Develop content for training and brown bag sessions
