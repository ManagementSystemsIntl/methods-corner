"Hello.  My name is ________________. I work for Integrity Global South Sudan, and we are conducting a survey of homes in your community. The purpose is to better understand how assistance provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in South Sudan can benefit communities. Your household was selected to participate in an interview that may take up to forty-five (45) minutes to complete. We will interview you and other members of your household as needed.

Your participation is completely voluntary. There are no known risks or discomforts associated with this survey. There will be no benefit provided to you because of your participation. We hope you will agree to answer the questions since your views and experiences are important. If I ask you any questions you don't want to answer, let me know and I will go on to the next question. You can also stop the interview at any time. The data collected in this survey may be used as part of a study in the future. If your household is selected for future study, then a second survey will be conducted. If you agree to participate in the second survey, the data from this survey will be used for comparison. If you decide not to participate in either survey or if you withdraw from participating at any time, you will not be penalized in any way.
Your privacy is important to us. No part of this interview is being recorded or videoed. If you agree to participate, some of the information you provide will be available on a public website that researchers and others will be able to access without identifying you. The information will be entered into a database that will NOT contain confidential information such as your name or the name of your village that could be used to identify you. Any data attached to your personal information will be stored in a password protected electronic format.

Do you have any questions about the survey or what I have said? If in the future you have any questions regarding the survey or the interview, or concerns or complaints, we welcome you to contact Frank Kabudula the Deputy Chief of Party of MELS in Juba, South Sudan at +211-926-145-323.

The interview will take about 45 minutes.
