a. Some of the approaches like dialogues affected development positively in a way that when the animal left, the farmers were above to continue with their activities until they harvested their crops. Unfortunately, this did not work for long when the animals/cattle returned again and have destroyed most of the farms leaving the owners(farmers) vulnerable of what and where find something to eat individually and at household level.  Part of Baggari Payam was affected by the cattle.
b. Destruction of crops as the main livelihood for the farmers surely leaves them empty and helpless. Therefore, the capacity of the community to be resilient has been greatly compromised.","To her, it appears that there is little collaboration between the IPs and the national organizations as some national organization have not entered into partnership. Additionally, there is the issue of the qualified national staff working with the national organizations leaving to work with international organizations. While this is ok, it reduces the capacity of the national organizations as they are left with no qualified staff. The issue of location and partnership seems to be more of a talk than being put in practice. The money given for service delivery should have proper monitoring system at the community level and the projects that are meant to benefit the women should not be diverted. Recruitment of staff to positions should be localized so that the youth who are graduates and have the relevant skills and knowledge can also access the job and improve their lives. Eventually, this will contribute positively to increasing the capacity of the local youth to withstand the shocks and stressors in the community of Wau and beyond. The issue of peacebuilding should be taken seriously because without peace, realizing development and becoming resilient as a community will be hard to reach. Finally, she thanked to Integrity Global for coming to carry out this exercise which gave the opportunity to express the concerns relating to the situation in Wau County.","drop out of school children due to lack of school fees, displaced of people from their places of residence including the situation in Sudan, heavy drinking and consumption/abuse of drugs by the youth, change of names of places by people who do not belong to the area making conflict, land grabbing and poor and bad roads among others.",NA

This is because there are services like schools, health facilities and centres that are built for community use (women and children friendly spaces). There are also training facilities, markets and CDMRR who are trained to respond to issues in the community. The people also can move to burn charcoal to sell as one of the livelihoods.
However, there are still many challenges in education, health because they are few and inefficient. Hence, there is need for construction of more schools, health centres so that those who can’t access the services get them.""

Unfortunately, the approach of having meetings and dialogue between the cattle owners and the farmers is not working because the cattle owners refuse to take their cattle away. As said, instead they turn to intimidate the farm owners by guns.
a. The approaches affect the development differently. In the case of short-term variety of seeds that were distributed by organizations like FAO, it means the farmers will be able to harvest their crops in the shortest time and this tend to act as food security as they have food to eat at household level, but also to sell the surplus to meet their other household needs like education of children, purchase of salt, soap, sugar etc. In short, the farmers can realize income when they harvest and sell more.
b. As for the cattle and drought, they affect the resilience of the communities negatively because they weaken the potential of farmers to withstand the shocks and stressors.""

Similarly, organizations have also organized for some meetings and dialogues between the cattle owners and the farmers to resolve the conflict peacefully. Unfortunately, the cattle keepers are often adamant and hardly move out. Instead, they threat the farmers with guns.

Although this looks advance, it is good because it could solve the problem of drought where farmers could produce during dry season by using the harvested water to irrigate their crops.

a. The wildlife largely come when the crops ae near harvest hence not very frequent. The cattle are seasonal as they are driven in the nearby communities by the owners. It is said that some of them belong to some government officials. The absence of rain is also season and does not happen frequently.
b. The wildlife and the cattle destroy the crops and the effect in the county is that there is reduced food as farmers harvest less. The lack of rainfall has made some crops to dry up and the further effects is that there will be food insecurity and less food will be supplied to the urban center from the rural areas where farming taking place. Again, with the lack of rain, the farmers will not be able to plant the seeds which were distributed to them and the more the seeds stay, they are likely to get expired.

As it is, there are no tractor that could fell the trees. If these could be provided, the farmers would be able to cultivate large peace of land and produce more food. 
There are also issues of pests and birds that destroy the crops. 
It is also, NGOs do not cover the whole of Wau County in terms of agriculture hence, is good if the agricultural support and services are extended across the county to increase the level of productivity thereby addressing the shocks and stressors in the county. ""
