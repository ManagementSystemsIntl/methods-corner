Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical theorem concerning a random variable that comprises two or more groups. The ANOVA theorem states that the variance of the random variable *y* that comprises two or more groups *x* can be decomposed into the sum of (i) the average of the subgroup variances, and (ii) the variance of the subgroup means.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$V(Y)=E_X(\sigma^2_{Y|X}) + V_X(\mu_{Y|X})$

This result is used most commonly to test the equality of means of the subgroups *x*. Introductory statistics texts present what is referred to as an ANOVA table.

## ANOVA Table

```{r}

aov_tab <- data.frame(errors=c("Between","Within","Total"),
                      squares=c("SSB","SSW","SST"),
                      #ss_act=c(ssb, ssw, sst),
                      df=c("g-1","N-g","N-1"),
                      #df_act = c(4-1, 400-4, 400-1),
                      mn_sq = c("SSB/DFB", "SSW/DFW", ""),
                      F=c("MSB/MSW","",""))
