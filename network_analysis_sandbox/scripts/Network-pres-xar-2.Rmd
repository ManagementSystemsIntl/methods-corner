## Key R libraries

There are a few core libraries that help with network analysis in R

--

.pull-left[The basics
- igraph
- ggraph
- tidygraph
]

--

.pull-right[A few extras that *may* help
- tidyverse
- ggiraph
- ggnetwork
- networkD3
- threejs
- visnetwork
- flextable
- sfnetworks

## Setting up a graph object
Edges: df

```{R echo = F}


df <- data.frame(name = c("Steve", "Steve", "Steve", "Cheryl", "Stephanie", "Stephanie")
                 , friend = c("Chris", "Cheryl", "Stephanie", "Chris", "Paulo", "Cheryl"))

DT::datatable(df
              , fillContainer = FALSE)

```

---
class: top, left
## Setting up a graph object
Vertices: df_nodes

```{R echo= F}
df_nodes <- data.frame(name = c("Steve"
                                , "Cheryl"
                                , "Stephanie"
                                , "Chris"
                                , "Paulo")) 
df_nodes <- df_nodes |>
  mutate(team = case_when(name == "Steve" | name == "Chris" ~ "A", name == "Cheryl" | name == "Stephanie" ~ "B", name == "Paulo" ~ "C"))

DT::datatable(df_nodes
              , fillContainer = FALSE)

```

# Setting up a graph object
Creating the graph object from the edges and vertices

```{R}
graph <-  graph_from_data_frame(  #<<
  df, #edges are here
                      vertices = df_nodes #nodes and their data are here
                      , directed = FALSE) # this is an undirected network

```

---

class: top, left
# Setting up a graph object
Now we can plot the network using `ggraph`

.pull-left[
```{R warning = FALSE}

graph_plot <- ggraph(graph
            , layout = "with_kk") +
  geom_edge_diagonal(width = 1
                 , color = "grey"
                 , alpha = .7) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = team)
                  , size = 16)+
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)
                 , size = 5.5)+ 
  theme_graph()

```
]

.pull-right[
```{R warning = FALSE,out.width = "80%"}

graph_plot
```
]

---
Now, let's load our dataset from the data science survey as a graph object. 

```{R }
#load mentor network data from files
edges_mentor <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("./network_analysis_sandbox/data/edges_mentor.xlsx"))
nodes_mentor <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("./network_analysis_sandbox/data/nodes_mentor.xlsx"))

#add a column for R user to the nodes
nodes_mentor <- nodes_mentor |>
  mutate(R_user = case_when(grepl("R", software) ~ "R"
                            , TRUE ~ "Other"))


#load technical guidance network data from files
edges_tech <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("./network_analysis_sandbox/data/edges_tech.xlsx"))
nodes_tech <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("./network_analysis_sandbox/data/nodes_tech.xlsx"))

#add a column for R user to the nodes
nodes_tech <- nodes_tech |>
  mutate(R_user = case_when(grepl("R", software) ~ "R"
                            , TRUE ~ "Other"))

#create two graph objects
graph_ment <- graph_from_data_frame(edges_mentor
                                    , directed = FALSE
                                    , vertices = nodes_mentor)
graph_tech <- graph_from_data_frame(edges_tech
                                    , directed = FALSE
                                    , vertices = nodes_tech)
```

---
Now to calculate centrality statistics for the following

**Density:** The ratio of the actual number of edges and the largest possible number of edges in the graph

**Distance:** The distance between two or more nodes in a network.

**Transitivity:** The probability that the adjacent vertices of a vertex are connected.

**Betweenness:** Roughly the number of shortest paths going through a node. It helps identify gatekeepers in a network. 

**Eigenvector centrality:** A measure of the relative influence of a node in a network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. 

--

### .center[**Let's get to it!**]

---

 
```{R}
#Calculate some network statistics - density, mean distance, betweeness, transitivity, and eigenvector centrality
#calculate the network density
density_ment <- edge_density(graph_ment)

#calculate the mean_distance
avg_dist_ment <- mean_distance(graph_ment, directed = FALSE)

#calculate the betweeness
b1 <- igraph::betweenness(graph_ment, directed = FALSE)
between_ment <- mean(b1)

#calculate the transitivity of the network
trans_ment <- transitivity(graph_ment)

#eigenvalues vector
e1 <- eigen_centrality(graph_ment, directed =FALSE)$vector
#calculate avg. eigenvalue of the network
eigen_ment <- mean(e1)
```
---


...Then we do this again for the technical guidance network, and we end up with ... 

```{R echo = FALSE}

network_table1
```

.center[So, how do we understand what this tells us?]
---
### Simulations are helpful here

We can calculate each of the above statistics for N simulated networks

```{R}
#this simulates 1000 iterations of a graph with the same number of nodes and edge_density
#set up a for loop 
gl_tech <- vector('list', 1000)

for(i in 1:1000){
  gl_tech[[i]] <- erdos.renyi.game( #<<
    n = gorder(graph_tech)
    , p.or.m = edge_density(graph_tech)
    , type = "gnp"
  )
}
```

So, we run each of the centrality statistics on 1,000 simulated "tech guidance" networks, and 1,000 simulated "mentoring" networks to give us a sense of what we would expect from similar networks.

### And the results are in

```{r echo = FALSE}

# How does this relate to our work?

We are parts of many social networks, and this is true of our activities and the staff who work on them.

- Organizational development: inter and intra organizational

--

- Policy reform

--

- Influence within teams

--

- Interorganizational structures
