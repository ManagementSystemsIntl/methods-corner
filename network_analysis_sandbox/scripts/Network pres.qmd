## Agenda {background-color="#003478"}

 - What is a network
 - Why is it important
 - How do I understand a network


# What is a network?

## A network is ...

 - A grouping of more than two people or things (for today we'll focus on people)
 - It describes the interconnectedness of the elements within it and how the different nodes (people) work together
 
```{r echo = FALSE}

#develop random network

df <- data.frame(name = c("Steve", "Steve", "Steve", "Chris", "Cheryl", "Cheryl", "Stephanie", "Stephanie", "Stephanie", "Paulo")
                 , friend = c("Chris", "Cheryl", "Stephanie", "Paulo", "Paulo", "Stephanie", "Steve", "Chris", "Paulo", "Chris"))

df <- df |>
  mutate(team = case_when(name == "Steve" | name == "Chris" ~ "A", name == "Cheryl" | name == "Paulo" ~ "B", name == "Stephanie" ~ "C"))

g <- graph_from_data_frame(df, directed = FALSE)


plot(g)
